C64 Joyswapper by Petri HÃ¤kkinen

This is the firmware for a Atmega328P based C64 mod. The ATmega328P microcontroller is added between the joystick ports and the keyboard matrix of a C64. After the modification the joystick ports can be swapped by toggling a switch.

See joyswapper.cpp for details.
